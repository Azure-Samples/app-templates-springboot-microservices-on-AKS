### Azure Configuration for GitHub  

The newly created GitHub repo uses GitHub Actions to deploy Azure resources and application code automatically. Your subscription is accessed using an Azure Service Principal. This is an identity created for use by applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources. The following steps show how to [set up GitHub Actions to deploy Azure applications](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md)

1. Create an [Azure Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) with **contributor** permissions on the subscription. The subscription-level permission is needed because the deployment includes creation of the resource group itself.
 * Run the following [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) command, either locally on your command line or on the Cloud Shell. 
   Replace {subscription-id} with the id of the subscription in GUID format. {service-principal-name} can be any alfanumeric string, e.g. GithubPrincipal
    ```bash  
       az ad sp create-for-rbac --name {service-principal-name} --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id} --sdk-auth      
      ```
 * The command should output a JSON object similar to this:
 ```
      {
        "clientId": "<GUID>",
        "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
        "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
        "tenantId": "<GUID>",
        "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "<URL>",
        "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "galleryEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "managementEndpointUrl": "<URL>"
      }
   ```
2. Store the output JSON as the value of a GitHub secret named 'AZURE_CREDENTIALS'
   + Under your repository name, click Settings. 
   + In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select Secrets, and select Actions. 
   + At the top of the page, click New repository secret
   + Provide the secret name as AZURE_CREDENTIALS
   + Add the output JSON as secret value

3. The following  parameters are required.

| Property | Description | Valid Options | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| `Azure_Credentials` | The JSON that is provided when you create a service principal. | |

4. Verify your Azure Permissions ( You must have Contributor, Owner and User Access Administrator roles)
      
  * Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires roleAssignment/write permission, so make sure  your Azure user account has Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permissions, such as User Access Administrator or Owner and Contributor. More info can be found in the documentation for [Azure built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

  + Go to your Subcription, look to the left hand side menu and select Access Control (IAM).

  + Select Role Assignments.

  + Type in the name of your Service Principal, check the access levels.

  + Since you just created it, the Service Principal will have Contributor Access.
