  * Push your app to the container registry
  * Create an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) Cluster
  * Deploy each of the Microservies to your AKS cluster
  * Verify your container images

* PetClinic on Automated CI/CD with GitHub Action  
  * CI/CD on GitHub Action
  * CI/CD in action with the app
